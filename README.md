## Usage

An application expose 5 REST endpoints for each entity. For example *Notice* (and any other) they are:

* **GET** `{baseURL}/notices/` - lists all *Notices* (as Json array),
* **GET** `{baseURL}/notices/{id}` - gets single *Notice* (as Json) by its `{id}`,
* **POST** `{baseURL}/notices/` - creates a new *Notice* which is passed in the BODY of the request,
* **PUT** `{baseURL}/notices/{id}` - updates an existing *Notice* (with an `{id}`) with `Notice` passed in the body of the request,
* **DELETE** `{baseURL}/notices/{id}`- deletes an existing *Notice* by its `{id}`.

If you run this application locally the `{baseUrl}` would be `http://localhost:8080`. 

All available endpoints are listed on *Swagger UI* page which can be entered, when application is running, under *http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html* URL.
